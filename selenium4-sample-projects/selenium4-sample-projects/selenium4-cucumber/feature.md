# Feature

### Feature Files (Cucumber)

Feature files (.feature) define test scenarios in a business-readable format using Gherkin syntax.

They describe application behavior from a user’s perspective and serve as the main input for Cucumber test execution.

***

#### Purpose

Feature files are used to:

* Describe application behavior in plain language
* Define test scenarios independently of implementation details
* Act as living documentation for the system under test
* Drive test execution through step definitions

***

#### Structure

A feature file typically consists of:

* Feature – High-level description of the functionality
* Scenario / Scenario Outline – Individual test cases
* Steps – Actions and validations written in Given / When / Then format
